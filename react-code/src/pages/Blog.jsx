                <p className="post-excerpt">How Bisleri built one of India's most iconic brands by mastering supply chain excellence and strategic positioning.</p>
                <div className="post-content">
                  <p>The other night, I was sitting with my cousins talking about companiesâ€”how some grow fast, some burn out, and some evolve to last.</p>
                  <p>Somewhere in the middle, I asked: "Wait, how does Bisleri even make money? It's just water."</p>
                  <p>That question sent me down a rabbit hole. And what I found:</p>
                  <p><strong>Bisleri</strong>: They've built one of the smartest, quietest business empires in India.</p>
                  <h3>The Foundation Story</h3>
                  <p>In 1969, Parle bought the Italian brand Bisleri for â‚¹4 lakh. At the time, bottled water was a luxury, limited to fancy hotels.</p>
                  <p>But Parle didn't sell luxury. They sold trust. â‚¹5 bottles that made clean water accessible, reliable, and even aspirational.</p>
                  <h3>The Genius of Supply Chain Mastery</h3>
                  <p>Over the years, Bisleri didn't just stick to water. They rolled out premium (Vedica), soda (high-margin gold), soft drinks (Spyci), same packaging system.</p>
                  <p>But every new product rode the same supply chainâ€”same trucks, same shelves, same retail.</p>
                  <p><strong>So, how does Bisleri really make money?</strong></p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Not all obvious are equal. Their biggest profits come from: The supply chain they own, not just the water they sell.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Here are the key revenue streams:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>The green cap you trust</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>A star Parle Ki Bottle Bisleri Nahi Hai?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>150+ plants, 6,000+ distributors</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Multilingual reach, Bisleri presence</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>The Strategic Brilliance</h3>
                  <p>They didn't chase attention. They owned association. And that's how Bisleri became the default word for bottled water in India.</p>
                  <p>In a world obsessed with disruption, Bisleri built an empire by mastering the most basic product we all need.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sometimes, boring is brilliant.</strong> ðŸ”¥</p>
